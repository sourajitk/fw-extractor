# Firmware Extractor

## What does this do?
This script will add firmware images for inclusion to your custom ROM build. The primary benefit of using this script is that you won't have to go through the tedious process of manually flashing firmware images from OFFICIAL OTAs. You will also be able to easefully include these images to your otapackages which then would allow everyone to stay up-to-date. 

## Setup
Clone this repo to `vendor/firmware/<codename of your device>`

## Usage
`./extract-images.sh`
